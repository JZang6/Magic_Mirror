TO BUILD THE PROJECT ON GAUL:
	- qmake-qt5 Magic_Mirror.pro
	- make
	- ./Magic_Mirror
	
TO BUILD THE PROJECT ON OTHER SYSTEMS
	- qmake Magic_Mirror.pro
	- make
	- ./Magic_Mirror
	
PLEASE NOTE:
	All features currently implemented work as they should. There is a slight bug sometimes from Qt where things are not drawn correctly to the screen for some reason. The bug is currently under investigation for the full release, but a simple restart is usually more than enough to fix the problem and get everything working as intended.
	
	It is also important to note that the News API is only good for 100 requests a day unless payment is made. Please do not exceed this number or the news scroller will not work.
	
	Finally, the user system that is going to be implemented has been completed and is working as intended. It is simply not implemented in this version of the build. The tasks on Jira are simply marked as completed for us to better keep track of what has been completed.
